# Pancreatic-Cancer-prediction-models

BACKGROUND

With a 5-year survival rate of only 12%, pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide.

Early diagnosis is vital for patient survival given the absence of effective therapies and diagnostic tests.

The prospect of detecting pancreatic cancer through non-invasive diagnostic approaches, such as blood or urine tests to measure cancer-specific biomarkers, is often regarded as the "holy grail" of cancer diagnostics. However, this area of research faces significant challenges due to the complexity of cancer types, patient heterogeneity and lack of biomarker specificity.

Achieving high accuracy in diagnostic tests remains a major obstacle in this endeavor.

OBJECTIVE

In this notebook I have applied some classical maschine learning models to a clinical dataset to predict pancreatic cancer based on clinical data.

THE DATA

The dataset is very well balanced as it includes 103 healthy controls, 208 non-cancer conditions and 199 cancer cases. It includes features such as patient demographics (sex and age) and levels of protein biomarkers (creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, and TFF1). It is important to note that features directly related to cancer, such as the stage of progression, are excluded from the prediction model.
